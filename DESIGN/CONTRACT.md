Team Contract
===========

As a member of team DrumpfTower, you must agree to the following:


####Communication
- Check Slack often enough to stay in the loop.
####Coding Practices
- Frequently Commit code, descriptive commits. 
 - Commit by topic areas, relevant commit messages.
     - I.e. DO NOT DO: “git add . -> git commit -m “fixed everything” -> git push”.
- Github branch hierarchy:
```
Master
└───authoring
    ├───authoring_frontend
    │   │   authoring_frontend_featurename1_netID
    │   │   authoring_frontend_featurename1_netID
    │   │   ...
    │
    └───authoring_backend
    │   │   authoring_backend_featurename1_netID
    │   │   authoring_backend_featurename1_netID
    │   │   ...
